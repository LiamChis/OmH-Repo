# OmH-Repo
This repo will be used to keep track of my Openm Health work with Shimmer. 

I will store code from Docker/Terminal here so myself and others can follow along with what I am doing. I will also add info about daily progress, other projets within my work in Shmmer, and any other relevant information. As I become more farmiliar with Github and its functons, everything will become more organized and more easily accessible. 

View Code-from-Terminal branch for code with comments. (Code -> main -> View all branches -> Code-from-Terminal -> Terminal Code (Mar2020))

  Not sure if I have put the code in the right place as it seems slightly difficult to find. For that reason, I have included the steps to follow to find the code.
