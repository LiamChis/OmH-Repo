# OmH-Repo
This repo will be used to keep track of my Openm Health work with Shimmer. 

I will store code from Docker/Terminal here so myself and others can follow along with what I am doing. I will also add info about daily progress, other projets within my work in Shmmer, and any other relevant information. As I become more farmiliar with Github and its functons, everything will become more organized and more easily accessible.
